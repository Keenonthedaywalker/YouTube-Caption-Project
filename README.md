# YouTube-Caption-Project
This project contains three files, they are "main.py", "count_files.py", and "remove_files.py". 

The main goal of this project is to retrieve the captions from all the YouTube videos on a channel, then to count the amount of times a certain word is used, for instance the word "firework". 
The captions are generated into text files and this is all done in the "main.py" file. 

Use the "count_files.py" file to count all of the word occurences accross all of the channel's videos, you can search for a specific word or multiple. 

Finally the objective of the "remove_files.py" file, is to remove any files that do not have the word or words that are being looked for. This clears some space on the drive and makes everything much easier to read.
